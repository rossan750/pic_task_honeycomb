    "p2": "You will be asked to rate how much you like or dislike the image. Please rate each image on a scale from -3 (Dislike Very Much) to +3 (Like Very Much). Zero (0) is neutral... meaning you have no feelings either way. It is important you rate each picture based on your initial emotional response. There are no right or wrong answers... just respond with your feelings, and rate the pictures very quickly.",
